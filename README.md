# Myanmar_Data_Analysis

Exploratory data analysis of deaths caused by ongoing conflicts in Myanmar using data from The Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP).


## Myanmar Data Analysis Initial Questions

Questions and hypothesis I am looking to get more insight to through exploratory data analysis:

- How much have conflict related deaths increased or decreased over the past 20 years? The country has never been a unified state and large areas of the country remain as rebel held territory. Conflict has erupted continuously for the past century but more recent conflicts I’m interested to find out about are the forced removal and genocide of Rohinga minorities in 2017, and the expected escalation in conflicts between armed groups since the 2020 coup d’etat.
- Are there significant differences in conflict related deaths between government held areas and contested territory? And if there is, does it coincide with major events e.g. the 2020 coup?
- Is data from ACLED and UCDP datasets significantly different? And do these datasets give similar answers to each other in relation to the previous questions?

These questions will give us a more in-depth knowledge about the conflict, and the data relating to it.


## Myanmar Death Figures Data Analysis

After cleaning the data from UCDP there were several key findings that relate to recent conflicts. 
When looking at the deaths per day and deaths per month caused by conflict, there have been conflicts occurring on and off since records began. There has not been any long periods of peace which show how unstable this 'country' really is. Below we can see all the data UCDP has on deaths caused by conflict in Myanmar.
